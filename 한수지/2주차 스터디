Information and communication engineering

Noise 
Thermal: Due to thermal agitation of electrons
Intermodulation: Produce signals that are the sum, difference or multiples of original frequencies sharing a medium.
Crosstalk: A signal from one line is picked up by another
Impulse: Noncontinuous noise consisting of irregular pulses or spikes of short duration and relatively high amplitude

Design Factor to determine data rate & distance
Bandwidth
 - Higher bandwidth gives higher data rate
Transmission impairments
 - Attenuation, Attenuation distortion, delay distortion, noise 
 - Impairments limit the distance 
Interference(crosstalk)
 - Interference from competing signals in overlapping frequency bands can distort or wipe out a signal
Number of receivers
 - On a shared link, each attachment introduces some attenuation and distortion,      limiting distance and /or data rate
 - More receivers introduces more attenuation
